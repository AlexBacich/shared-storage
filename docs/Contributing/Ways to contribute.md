### How can I contribute?

Code is not the only thing matters when we talk about packages and open-source libraries, there's a lot of another tasks which are equally important:

- Reporting bugs
- Useful questions
- Creating show-cases
- Improving dodcumentation
- Asking questions
- Answering questions
- Sharing ideas
- Reporting usage issues (Something looks wrong on API?)
