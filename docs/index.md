### Partial Support for [Environment](./Usage/Environment.md)

Mirror API from [Environment](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/environment.dart' as environment;
```

### Partial Support for [Media Store](./Usage/Media%20Store.md)

Mirror API from [MediaStore provider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/media_store.dart' as mediastore;
```

### Partial Support for [Storage Access Framework](./Usage/Storage%20Access%20Framework.md)

Mirror API from [Storage Access Framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider)

```dart
import 'package:shared_storage/saf.dart' as saf;
```

All these APIs are module based, which means they are implemented separadely and so you need to import those you want use.

> To request support for some API that is not currently included open a issue explaining your usecase and the API you want to make available, the same applies for new methods or activities for the current APIs.

## Android APIs

Most Flutter plugins use Android API's under the hood. So this plugin does the same, and to call native Android storage APIs the following API's are being used:

[`ðŸ”—android.os.Environment`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Environment#summary) [`ðŸ”—android.provider.MediaStore`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore#summary) [`ðŸ”—android.provider.DocumentsProvider`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider)
